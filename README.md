## PinoyFlix (A netflix clone by avi)

**What is PinoyFlix?**

Welp-- PinoyFlix, in a nutshell, is a subscription-based Pinoy Movie and TV Show streaming site (how I envision it) where people can watch their favorite Filipino films, TV shows from their PC or mobile browser. Don't even miss your fave tele-dramas with PinoyFlix lmao

## Tech Stack

Front-End: `ReactJS`, `Redux`, and `Redux Toolkit`
Back-End: `Firebase`
APIs: `TMDB`

In this project, [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) was used to call Filipino TV shows and movies using middleware `axios`. Google Authentication was also integrated into the project.

## Just FYI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. 

Hosted on Firebase.
